Who's the most exclamation and inquisitive?
```{r}

friends_df <- friends_lines_raw %>% 
  filter(speaker %in% c("Monica Geller", "Rachel Green", "Phoebe Buffay", "Ross Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Joey Tribbiani")) %>% 
  mutate(exclaim = str_count(text, "!"),
         quest = str_count(text, pattern = "\\?")) %>% 
  group_by(speaker, season, episode) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(exclaimation = sum(exclaim),
                   question = sum(quest)) %>% 
  unite(col = "season.ep", c("season", "episode"), sep = ".", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup()  %>% 
  arrange(season, episode) %>%
  mutate(season = factor(season)) %>% 
  group_by(speaker) %>% 
  mutate(rn = row_number()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(season, speaker) %>% 
  mutate(avg_ex = mean(exclaimation),
         avg_ques = mean(question)) %>%

Colors!
```{r}  
my_palette <- cal_palette(name = "kelp1")
more_pal <- colorRampPalette(my_palette)(10)
show_col(more_pal)
```
  
Make the plot!  
```{r}

   ## don't forget all the written info!
